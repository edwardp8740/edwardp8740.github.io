            <h1 class="margin text-center">SEP-10 Freedom Project</h1>
            <p>This project was a year long project that I made in 10th grade.</p>
            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p> The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing. </p>
            <h4>Content</h4>
            <p> For my project, I chose the topic of Architecture. I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study A-frame in order to help me make my website. My website's purpose is to help inform people of architeceture and give a starting point for current and future architects that might need help finding hardware tools to help make their experience faster and easier, and software apps that could help with making 3D art more clearer and easier to draw. </p>
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <p>Â When making my projects I came accross a bunch of challenges such as errors, bugs, and many more different types. Some of my most memorial challenges were ones when I was working on fixing small details to make my project feel and look just a bit better. For example, I used to have a simple black and white color scheme but then I turned everything into a nice blue color scheme to make up for the bland color scheme I had before. Another example of a challenge I came across was when I tried making two carousels for my images but only one worked and my other didn't. </p>
            <h4>Takeaway</h4>
            <p> The biggest takeaway I got from this project was that mistakes are ok. I dewelled a lot on mistakes I made or simple errors that I didn't know how to fix. It made me feel as if my project wouldn't be as good as others but I evenutally realized that mistakes will happen, especially on projects as big as this, which is why mistakes are ok. I realized that I should instead learn from my mistakes to prevent them from happening in the future or find ways around them. </p>
            <h4>Next Step</h4>
            <p> For the future projects that I will make, I will try to add everything I've learned from this year long project like webdesign and stuff from a-frame. Not just that, but I will also try and use all the skills, takeaways, and other real world tools I've learned from the past year to help improve projects I will make in the future. </p>
