            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie webpage </h1>
            <p> After learning HTML and CSS, we were assigned a project. We had a make a webpage for a fake movie using CSS and HTML with a partner. </p>
            <p>My partner and I made a webpage for a fake movie called Cravan</p>
            <div class="row">

              
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <img src="../img/movie-webpage.png" class="img-fluid project-img">
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p>This is a screenshot of a part of my movie webpage.</p>
                    <p> When viewing the code for the project you can also see the plan for the project. The plan include who did what and a summary of the movie. Although we were assigned to do specific parts of the project, we helped each other if we were stuck or if we saw code errors so we each did a bit of everything. </p>
                </div>
                <p> I think the biggest challenge that we came up with was creating a text that could fade into a different color, because it wasn't something we learned in class yet and we had to learn it on our own time, so we had a few bugs with it but eventually figured it out.Â </p>
                <p> Something I'm going to take away from this is that if I want to learn something new or add something new we didn't go over, I should ask my teacher or ask someone who has more experience with coding so that I can set it up properly and quickly.</p>
                <p> In the future when I learn more about coding I think I'd like to add more to this project, like developing the story of the movie more and make a link to a sequel connecting each movive to each other. Overall just using new things I will learn and trying to put it into this project. </p>
